# Re-center: what was done

The [report](REPORT.md) is the review and plan as the owner approved it on 2026-09-25. This page records what each phase did,
with the figures its gate asked for.

## Phase 0: pause, tidy, tell the truth (2026-09-25)

| Item | What was done |
|---|---|
| The goal written down | [docs/GOALS.md](../../GOALS.md): the goal, the method, the two data tiers, the scorecard, what is decided and not yet built (D83 to D85), the working rules. `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` and `docs/README.md` send a reader there first |
| Imports paused | `AGENTS.md` ("Importing a batch of data sheets") and the head of `PLAN-REMAINING.md`, which is marked superseded as the working plan |
| The close report corrected | V2's `RESPONSE.md` said every ledger row was terminal; 39 were `held`. Corrected, with a note on who reviewed and what parity measures |
| Who reviewed | Every one of the 20,478 review decisions in the import's proposals is an agent's. `AGENTS.md` now says "a named reviewer (a person, or an agent named as one)" and that a report must say which |
| What parity measures | `ingest:propose -- --compare --all` now also scores the reader against only the values recorded before the import (up to V002645, commit 73de8d2), which it did not write; STATUS.md shows both. **Independent parity 87.1 %** (1,759 of 2,020 values on 141 sheets), against a regression figure of 96.6 %. Most makers imported in V2 have one such sheet or none |
| Stale documents | DATA-MODEL (counts in the diagram, the calibration table and the estimate counts now point at `build/reports/validation-report.md`), ARCHITECTURE (payload size), HOW-IT-WORKS ("about a hundred filaments"), README (the mode buttons' names), PIPELINE (a timing that contradicted itself, a test file's name), OPEN-PROBLEMS §8 (source counts), `docs/README.md` and `docs/audits/README.md` (the index), the b27 batch title, `bundle.js` and `ui-fuzz.mjs` comments |
| Decisions | D83 (a material is the range of its products), D84 (two evidence levels) and D85 (the record tier) are written in GOALS.md as decided; each enters DECISIONS.md in the change that builds it |
| Faster checks | The build result is cached by content (`build/src/build-cache.js`, `.cache/build/`, keyed on the tables in memory, the build code, the runtime and the options; a private copy per hit; off in CI, in the audit's rebuild, the scale check and the reproducibility test, and with `H2C_NO_BUILD_CACHE=1`). Tests that look only for a compile or validate error build without estimates; the declared-variant test's four builds run in parallel; the import pipeline's tests moved to `npm run test:ingest`, which `verify` runs. Five tests pin the cache key and its entries |

**Gate.**

| | Before | After |
|---|---:|---:|
| `verify:fast`, after a change (empty cache) | about 168 s | 75 s |
| `verify:fast`, nothing the build reads changed | about 168 s | 29 s |
| Tests passing | 433 | 438 (274 in `npm test`, 164 in `test:ingest`; 5 new) |
| `npm run verify`, end to end | documented as about 24 min | 3 min 39 s, passing |
| `npm run build:diff` | | 0 differences |

`dist/db.json`, `reference.json` and the page are byte-identical with the cache off, on a cold run and on a hit.

**Found, not changed:** a build result shares two module constants (`db.meta.h2cBaseline`,
`db.meta.estimateModel.levels`), so a caller that edits one changes later builds in its process; the cache hands out
copies, but the build should copy them itself. `build/package.json`'s own `test` script still runs every file.

**Branching (owner, 2026-09-25).** V2 is not merged into `main` and is not tagged as a release: the owner is not
satisfied with the state V2 closed in. The re-center is how V2 gets finished, so it continues on the `v2` branch, one
commit per phase step; `main` stays at V1 until the re-centered V2 passes its phase 3 gate and the owner asks.

**Waiting on the owner:** the taxonomy decision in phase 5 (Bambu's product lines as products of their material, an
"other / unspecified" home per family).

## Phase 1: every product's own values and print recipe, by rule (2026-09-25)

`build/src/products.js` adds, beside each material's headline and deciding nothing yet:

- **`grades[].headline[key]`**: each product's own value per headline, chosen by rule from its own measurements, at
  one of two levels (D84 as decided): comparable, or as published where the source leaves the direction or the load
  unstated. A `headlines.csv` value row pins its product's value.
- **`grades[].print`**: each product's own recipe from its own profiles: the gate and window per axis, enclosure,
  hardened nozzle, drying, and the annealing its sheets state. Never a union across the material.
- **`materials[].summary[key]`**: the spread across the material's procurement products that are not declared
  variants: products, n comparable, range, quartiles, median, the typical product, and the as-published values and
  variants counted apart.

`aggregateGate` moved to `build/src/gates.js` and `cents` to `normalize/values.js`, unchanged, so a product and a
material share them. The contract (`schema/db.schema.json`) describes the three additions; the snapshot gains
`products.csv` and `summaries.csv`, and `npm run sql` gains `products_compiled` and `summaries_compiled`.

**Gate.**

| | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm run build:diff` | only `db.grades[].headline` (1,098), `db.grades[].print` (1,098) and `db.materials[].summary` (153): nothing that existed moved |
| The rule against the 477 hand picks | **all 477 agree** (471 the same measurement, 6 the same value): [rule-vs-hand-picks.md](rule-vs-hand-picks.md). The picks are redundant, which phase 4 acts on |
| Headlines the hand left empty that the rule fills on the representative grade | 122, listed in the same report (PLA's strength among them: a printed XY break strength of 56 MPa nobody selected) |
| Product values | 3,356 on 3,318 distinct measurements, against 2,166 measurements on representative grades before: density 843; modulus 254 comparable + 307 as published; strength 335 + 393; elongation 328 + 361; heat deflection 415 + 82; price 38 |
| PLA, stiffness | 27 comparable products, 0.95–2.95 GPa, median 2.27, none at 3 GPa; 46 as published, 1.44–4.78 GPa, 30 of them at 3 GPa or more; 11 variants apart. The report's first figures (0.95–3.4, 49) came from a looser query and are corrected there |
| Tests | 9 new (`test/products.test.js`), each a rule over every product; 283 pass in `npm test` |
| `verify:fast` / `verify` | 71 s cold / 3 min 1 s, passing |
| `db.json` / page | 20.1 → 20.8 MiB / 6.03 → 6.14 MiB |

Where the hand picks sat matters for phase 2: the report lists, per material, the share of its products at or below
the picked value. 87 picks sit at an extreme (0 % or 100 %) of their material; PA12-CF's stiffness, for one, was 8 GPa
against a median of 3.3 across its four comparable products.

Not built in this step, and why: a print summary per material (the engine will need the products' recipes, not a
summary of them; the table's print columns come in phase 3), and D83/D84 in DECISIONS.md (they are entered with the
phase 2 change that makes them decide).
