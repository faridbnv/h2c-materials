# Re-center: what was done

The [report](REPORT.md) is the review and plan as the owner approved it on 2026-09-25. This page records what each phase did,
with the figures its gate asked for.

## Phase 0: pause, tidy, tell the truth (2026-09-25)

| Item | What was done |
|---|---|
| The goal written down | [docs/GOALS.md](../../GOALS.md): the goal, the method, the two data tiers, the scorecard, what is decided and not yet built (D83 to D85), the working rules. `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` and `docs/README.md` send a reader there first |
| Imports paused | `AGENTS.md` ("Importing a batch of data sheets") and the head of `PLAN-REMAINING.md`, which is marked superseded as the working plan |
| The close report corrected | V2's `RESPONSE.md` said every ledger row was terminal; 39 were `held`. Corrected, with a note on who reviewed and what parity measures |
| Who reviewed | Every one of the 20,478 review decisions in the import's proposals is an agent's. `AGENTS.md` now says "a named reviewer (a person, or an agent named as one)" and that a report must say which |
| What parity measures | `ingest:propose -- --compare --all` now also scores the reader against only the values recorded before the import (up to V002645, commit 73de8d2), which it did not write; STATUS.md shows both. **Independent parity 87.1 %** (1,759 of 2,020 values on 141 sheets), against a regression figure of 96.6 %. Most makers imported in V2 have one such sheet or none |
| Stale documents | DATA-MODEL (counts in the diagram, the calibration table and the estimate counts now point at `build/reports/validation-report.md`), ARCHITECTURE (payload size), HOW-IT-WORKS ("about a hundred filaments"), README (the mode buttons' names), PIPELINE (a timing that contradicted itself, a test file's name), OPEN-PROBLEMS §8 (source counts), `docs/README.md` and `docs/audits/README.md` (the index), the b27 batch title, `bundle.js` and `ui-fuzz.mjs` comments |
| Decisions | D83 (a material is the range of its products), D84 (two evidence levels) and D85 (the record tier) are written in GOALS.md as decided; each enters DECISIONS.md in the change that builds it |
| Faster checks | The build result is cached by content (`build/src/build-cache.js`, `.cache/build/`, keyed on the tables in memory, the build code, the runtime and the options; a private copy per hit; off in CI, in the audit's rebuild, the scale check and the reproducibility test, and with `H2C_NO_BUILD_CACHE=1`). Tests that look only for a compile or validate error build without estimates; the declared-variant test's four builds run in parallel; the import pipeline's tests moved to `npm run test:ingest`, which `verify` runs. Five tests pin the cache key and its entries |

**Gate.**

| | Before | After |
|---|---:|---:|
| `verify:fast`, after a change (empty cache) | about 168 s | 75 s |
| `verify:fast`, nothing the build reads changed | about 168 s | 29 s |
| Tests passing | 433 | 438 (274 in `npm test`, 164 in `test:ingest`; 5 new) |
| `npm run verify`, end to end | documented as about 24 min | 3 min 39 s, passing |
| `npm run build:diff` | | 0 differences |

`dist/db.json`, `reference.json` and the page are byte-identical with the cache off, on a cold run and on a hit.

**Found, not changed:** a build result shares two module constants (`db.meta.h2cBaseline`,
`db.meta.estimateModel.levels`), so a caller that edits one changes later builds in its process; the cache hands out
copies, but the build should copy them itself. `build/package.json`'s own `test` script still runs every file.

**Branching (owner, 2026-09-25).** V2 is not merged into `main` and is not tagged as a release: the owner is not
satisfied with the state V2 closed in. The re-center is how V2 gets finished, so it continues on the `v2` branch, one
commit per phase step; `main` stays at V1 until the re-centered V2 passes its phase 3 gate and the owner asks.

**Waiting on the owner:** the taxonomy decision in phase 5 (Bambu's product lines as products of their material, an
"other / unspecified" home per family).
