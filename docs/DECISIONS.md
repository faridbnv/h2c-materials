# Decisions

The choices that are not obvious, and the bugs that forced several of them. Each says what would
break if it were reversed, because that is the part that gets lost.

---

## D1. Excel is the authoring format; JSON is the runtime

A browser can parse XLSX, but doing so couples the interface to workbook layout, pushes validation
failures into the user's session, and makes output non-deterministic. The workbook is never written
by anything here.

## D2. Headline values are verified, never recomputed

The Materials sheet already cites the MeasurementID behind each headline. The build checks the
number equals its citation rather than deriving a headline itself. All 348 reconcile.

This converts a class of judgement calls into build errors. Corrupting one density cell produces a
named error and no output.

## D3. Missing data is four states, never zero

Not published, insufficient comparable data, not applicable, quarantined. They mean different things
and are different engineering answers. A tool that renders them all as blank invites the reader to
assume the value is low.

## D4. INDETERMINATE is not UNKNOWN

UNKNOWN means no comparable evidence exists. INDETERMINATE means evidence exists and the threshold
cuts through it. Collapsing them would turn "the source cannot settle this" into "nobody has
measured this", which sends the reader looking for the wrong thing.

## D5. Evidence outranks silence in gate aggregation

A material's process gate aggregates across its profiles with precedence
`within > exceeds-recommended > exceeds > unknown`.

PEEK publishes two profiles demanding 390–430 and 400–480 °C against the printer's 350 °C, plus one
that publishes nothing. Letting the silent profile decide reported PEEK as "unknown" and discarded
real evidence. With the precedence corrected, all six excluded materials trip the envelope gate on
their own published requirements, independently agreeing with the workbook's own `Scope` column.
PPS-GF still reports "within", because one of its grades genuinely fits.

## D6. A recommendation is not a requirement

"Recommended 70-140C if possible" exceeds the 65 °C chamber but does not make the material
unprintable. Treating it as a hard requirement would wrongly exclude printable materials; ignoring
it would hide a real caveat. It returns `exceeds-recommended`, which warns without excluding.

## D7. Only gates that can discriminate become filters

Section 8.2A of the brief lists eleven process gates and says they should come first. The Print setup
sheet does not support that: routing and AMS read "verify the exact grade" on 133 of 156 profiles,
enclosure is unpublished on 142, difficulty on all 156.

Five gates ship: scope, H2C status, the three parsed temperatures against the baseline, plus
abrasion and drying. The rest appear as evidence in a material's Printing tab. A filter that passes
everything is worse than no filter, because it teaches the reader to trust a check that checked
nothing.

## D8. Related evidence reports one measurement, never a cross-grade range

PEBA's three grades measure 7.5, 25 and 30 MPa. "7.5 to 30" reads as one material's uncertainty
rather than three different products, and the Method sheet forbids cross-grade family ranges.

## D9. No cross-property fallback

An earlier version fell back to Vicat or glass transition where a material had no HDT. For TPE that
put a glass transition of −35 °C in a column headed "HDT at 0.45 MPa" — a different physical
quantity, and actively dangerous for anyone screening on heat resistance. Same-property only.

## D10. A family estimate may rule out, never rule in

The asymmetry is the whole design. Knowing every measured unreinforced PLA falls between 2.8 and
15.3% elongation is enough to say PLA Lite is not an elastomer. It is not enough to certify PLA Lite
clears a 5% floor, because the bound is drawn from its relatives.

Reversing this would let inference satisfy a requirement, which the brief forbids outright. Before
estimates, a search for elongation at least 100% returned 35 materials including PLA Lite and the
nylons; it now returns 14, of which 8 are genuine elastomers and 6 are supports that honestly have
no peers.

## D11. Estimates never pool across behaviour classes

"All unreinforced materials" spanned TPU at 0.0053 GPa and PLA at 2.88 GPa. Three orders of
magnitude rules nothing out and implies a support material might be as stiff as a structural one.
Elastomers, supports and rigid thermoplastics are separate populations.

## D12. Peers sharing a formulation key count once

PA, PA6/66 and CoPA all draw their headline from a single PolyMide datasheet. Counting them as three
peers produced an "estimate" of 2.223 to 2.223 GPa: a precise value dressed as a range, claiming
three corroborations where there is one. The Method sheet states the rule directly.

## D13. The reference layer is separate and off by default

114 generic materials compile to their own file and never enter the candidate set, counts, Pareto
fronts, search or exports. They are bulk and molded values while the candidates are printed and
anisotropic, which is exactly the silent condition-mixing guardrail 4 forbids. On by explicit choice,
with a banner.

## D14. The engine never imports from the interface

It is what makes the decision logic testable without a browser, and it is enforceable by inspection.

## D15. Tabulator was dropped; Plotly kept

The brief names both. At 102 rows a data grid's virtues do not apply, every cell needs custom
rendering for the provenance typography, and sorting plus export came to about a hundred lines. That
removed 430 KB and a dependency.

Plotly earns its size on log axes, error bars, shapes and lasso. Its parallel-coordinates trace does
not: it needs WebGL, which fails outright on many machines, so that lens is hand-drawn in SVG.

## D16. The data is embedded gzipped

Raw `db.json` is about 3 MB, almost all repeated condition strings; gzipped it is under 200 KB,
inflated at boot with `DecompressionStream`. No schema change, no interning, and the plotting
library rather than the data becomes what the file weighs.

# Bugs worth remembering

Each is pinned by a test. They are listed because all of them produced plausible-looking wrong
answers rather than failing.

| Bug | What it did | Pinned by |
|---|---|---|
| Leading minus in the number pattern | Read the dash in `255-275C` as the sign of -275, which failed the plausibility window and collapsed the range to 255 | `normalize.test.js` |
| Annealing text scraped as a chamber requirement | `Room Temp. Annealing temp. and time 100 °C/16H` wrongly excluded four printable support materials | `normalize.test.js` |
| Silence outranking evidence in gates | Reported PEEK as "unknown" despite two profiles demanding 430 and 480 °C | `database.test.js` |
| Excel booleans | SheetJS renders them `TRUE`/`FALSE` while the stored XML holds `1`/`0`; every price headline failed to verify | `normalize.test.js` |
| `String.replace` with a string payload | `$&` in minified library source scattered the placeholder tag through the bundle 30 times | asserted in `bundle.js` |
| Plotly shape coordinates on log axes | Are in log space; passing raw values put the steel reference rectangle at 10^215 | visual |
| Policy drift | An unrecognised policy made verdict and eligibility disagree, so a shared Explore link rendered as Strict | `constraints.test.js` |
| `text-overflow: ellipsis` on table cells | Clipped the UNKNOWN chip to a stray dot and "Not published" to "Not publis…" | visual |
| Cross-grade estimate ranges | Turned one PolyMide datasheet into "2.223 to 2.223 GPa" | `database.test.js` |
